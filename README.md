I am an open-source software engineer, currently working at [Decodable](https://www.decodable.co/), involved with data streaming based on Apache Flink.
Before joining Decodable, I spent ten years at Red Hat, where I led the Debezium project, a platform for change data capture.

I have been a long-time committer to multiple [open-source projects](https://morling.dev/projects), including Debezium, Hibernate, kcctl ðŸ§¸, JfrUnit, MapStruct and Deptective;
I also serve as the spec lead for Bean Validation 2.0 (first at the JCP, now under the Jakarta EE umbrella at the Eclipse Foundation).

Named a [Java Champion](https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=19297:3::::::), I enjoy [speaking at conferences](https://morling.dev/conferences), for instance at QCon, JavaOne, Red Hat Summit, JavaZone, JavaLand and Kafka Summit.

Occasionally, I [blog](https://morling.dev/blog) about topics related to software engineering.
